- fix star (broken by backend - was working)
- limit precision of geo when formatting to +9.9(5)
- fix image upload

- fix pin
- BLOCKED: fix loading Starred Posts stream
    - Matigo confirmed this stream is not currently supported.

- image upload - though Nice flubbed it for me, so
- fix "View in WebView" for new URLs
- fix account viewing - need to fetch the full account vs using what's embedded in a post. the embed can be a useful stop-gap while loading, but those -1 values are gross.
- trim any streams that don't work with v5
- drop "Repost" action if no longer relevant
- verify other post actions still work

- displaying & adding tags
- adding geo
- check we can read out geo of 0,0 0m.

- ability to post different post types - quote, bookmark, title, etc.
- share extension for quote / bookmark?

- seem to be mis-parsing this post and falling back on Markdown rather than rendering the pre-formatted code correctly:

XML_ERR_USER_STOP

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20454853/nsxmlparsererrordomain-111

"There isn't a lot of documentation on XML_ERR_USER_STOP in libxml2, but from reading the changeset, it looks like it's a fast-fail when the parser sees an unexpected EOF."

Dumped the parser location for a different case of this:

<body><p><span class="account" data-guid="15ea0169-9407-11e8-bbd7-54ee758049c3">@nitinkhanna</span> This work

a-guid="07d2f4ec-545f-11e8-99a0-54ee758049c3">@matigo</span></p></body>

There, it's barfing at char 138, which is the # in &#92;.
This numeric character reference ought to be legit - it's ASCII decimal 92,
which is the backslash.

Expected - there's a fake URL in there with a placeholder from Matigo.
