- posting:
    - checking if auth'd
    - authing
    - posting
    - editing
    - image upload - though Nice flubbed it for me, so

- tags
- check we can read out geo of 0,0 0m.

- seem to be mis-parsing this post and falling back on Markdown rather than rendering the pre-formatted code correctly:

XML_ERR_USER_STOP
