## Background
Macchiato is an iOS and iPadOS client for the micropost portion - the posts sometimes called "blurbs" - of the [10Centuries social network](https://10centuries.org).

[Jeremy W. Sherman](https://jeremywsherman.com) built it originally in 2016 as a minimal personal project, as an alternative to the mobile Web site, and as a way to play with Swift when Swift was new and most projects had not picked it up as their primary language. He then shared it for a few years via TestFlight, from January 2017 till September 2020.

Its development blog remains at: https://macchiato.10centuries.org

## Why Open Source
- I'm still using the app daily.
- Others on 10C would like to use it.
- So this lets other Centurions build and run it themselves. (And rebuild it as Apple's codesigning regularly demandsâ€¦)

## The Code
This project's code is not an example for you to follow! It is thoroughly un-modern in its Swift usage. For example, the codebase predates Codable, and it was never updated to use it.

The HTML to attributed string code is still pretty fun, though.

And I believe the VoiceOver support is fairly good.

## The License
I chose a fairly unconventional license. You should give it a read, as it is unconventional in part because it is a _readable_ license. You can find a copy in the LICENSE.md file. The canonical presentation is at https://indiecc.com/free/1.2.3.
